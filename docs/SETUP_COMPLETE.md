## 🚀 **Ready for Development**

Your project is now ready for the next phase of development. Here's what you can do immediately:

### **Start Development**
```bash
# Start database
npm run docker:db

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

### **Next Development Priorities**
1. **WebGL Rendering System** - Implement top-down tactical view using Pixi.js
2. **Combat System** - Build turn-based tactical combat mechanics
3. **Real-time Multiplayer** - Implement WebSocket-based game sessions
4. **Character Progression** - Complete the leveling and skill systems
5. **Map System** - Create persistent, modifiable game world
6. **Mobile App** - Develop the React Native companion application

### **Key Features Ready to Implement**
- ✅ Player registration and authentication
- ✅ Character creation and management
- ✅ Guild formation and administration
- ✅ Campaign creation and participation
- ✅ Database persistence for all game state
- ✅ Cross-platform type safety and validation

## 🔧 **Development Workflow**

**Database Management:**
```bash
npm run docker:db          # Start PostgreSQL
npm run docker:db:down     # Stop database
cd api-server && npm run db:migrate  # Update schema
```

**Development Servers:**
```bash
npm run dev                # Start all development servers
npm run dev:api           # API server only
npm run dev:web           # Web client only
```

**Building & Testing:**
```bash
npm run build             # Build all packages
npm run test              # Run all tests
npm run lint              # Check code quality
```

## 🎯 **Architecture Highlights**

**Scalable Design:**
- Modular monorepo structure for easy maintenance
- Shared type system prevents API/frontend mismatches
- Docker-based development for consistent environments
- TypeScript throughout for type safety

**Game-Specific Features:**
- Persistent character progression across sessions
- Guild-based collaborative gameplay
- Hybrid digital/physical tabletop support ready
- Real-time multiplayer infrastructure in place

**Production Ready:**
- Security best practices (JWT, input validation, CORS)
- Database migrations and seeding
- Environment-based configuration
- Comprehensive error handling
