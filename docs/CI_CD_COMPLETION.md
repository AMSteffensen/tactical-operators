# 🎉 CI/CD Pipeline & Deployment Setup - COMPLETED

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your tactical-operator game now has a **complete, production-ready CI/CD pipeline** with free hosting deployment configurations. Here's what has been set up:

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

### Continuous Integration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Multi-version testing**: Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- **Database integration**: PostgreSQL test database
- **Security audits**: npm audit for vulnerabilities
- **Build validation**: Tests all packages (shared, api-server, web-client, mobile-app)
- **Linting & formatting**: ESLint and Prettier checks
- **Cross-platform testing**: Ubuntu environment

### Continuous Deployment (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- **Railway deployment**: Automated API server deployment
- **Vercel deployment**: Automated web client deployment  
- **Expo mobile builds**: EAS build system integration
- **Environment-specific configs**: Production environment variables
- **Deployment triggers**: Deploys on main branch pushes and version tags

---

## 🚀 Hosting Platform Configuration

### 🚂 Railway (Backend + Database)
- **API Server**: Node.js Express app with Socket.IO
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Persistent data storage
- **Configuration**: `railway.json` with health checks and auto-restart
- **Cost**: Free tier ($5 credit/month, ~500 hours)

### 🌐 Vercel (Frontend)
- **Web Client**: React + TypeScript + WebGL
- **Static hosting**: Optimized build with CDN
- **Configuration**: `vercel.json` with API routing
- **Cost**: Free tier (100 deployments/month, 100GB bandwidth)

### 📱 Expo EAS (Mobile App)
- **React Native builds**: iOS and Android
- **EAS Build integration**: Automated mobile CI/CD
- **Cost**: Free tier (15 builds/month)

---

## 🐳 Docker Production Setup

### API Server (`api-server/Dockerfile`)
- **Multi-stage build**: Optimized production image
- **Security**: Non-root user, minimal attack surface
- **Health checks**: Automatic container health monitoring
- **Size optimization**: Alpine Linux base image

### Web Client (`web-client/Dockerfile`)
- **Nginx serving**: Static file optimization
- **Production build**: Vite optimized bundle
- **Custom configuration**: `nginx.conf` for SPA routing
- **Security headers**: Production-ready HTTP headers

## 📋 What You Need to Do Next

To deploy your game to production, you need to:

### 1. **Set up hosting platform accounts** (5-10 minutes each)
```bash
# Railway
1. Sign up at https://railway.app
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Create project from your repository

# Vercel  
1. Sign up at https://vercel.com
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Import your project

# Expo
1. Sign up at https://expo.dev
2. Install EAS CLI: npm install -g eas-cli
3. eas login
```

### 2. **Configure GitHub Secrets** (5 minutes)
Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and add:
```
RAILWAY_TOKEN=your_railway_token
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token  
VERCEL_ORG_ID=your_org_id
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
EXPO_TOKEN=your_expo_token
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.railway.app
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-api.railway.app
```

### 3. **Push to trigger deployment** (1 minute)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to production"
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 Deployment Workflow

Once configured, your deployment workflow will be:

1. **Push code** → GitHub Actions triggers
2. **CI runs** → Tests, builds, security checks
3. **CD deploys** → Railway (API), Vercel (Web), Expo (Mobile)
4. **Production ready** → Game accessible at your custom URLs
