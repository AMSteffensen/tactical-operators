## üîç Discovered During Work

### Port & Configuration Issues (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)
- **Issue**: macOS Control Center uses port 5000, causing API server startup conflicts
- **Solution**: Changed API server to port 3001, updated all references in configs
- **Files Updated**: `.env`, `vite.config.ts`, `docker-compose.yml`, documentation

### Module System Resolution (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)  
- **Issue**: ES Module/CommonJS conflicts between shared package and API server
- **Solution**: Converted all packages to CommonJS, removed `"type": "module"` declarations
- **Tools Added**: `tsconfig-paths` for runtime path resolution

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: WebGL & Real-time System (January 3, 2025)

## üìÖ Planning

* Update `TASK.md` after each completed or started task
* Add newly discovered tasks under ‚ÄúDiscovered During Work‚Äù
* Reflect dependencies (e.g. guilds depend on player system)
* Discuss major changes in `PLANNING.md` before implementation
