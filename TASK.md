## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Railway Deployment ES Module Fix (July 5, 2025)

**Successfully resolved Railway deployment failures and ES module compatibility issues.**

### Issue Resolution
- **Root Cause**: Railway deployment failing with Prisma client initialization errors and ES module/CommonJS conflicts
- **Primary Issue**: Shared package was building as CommonJS but web client expected ES modules
- **Secondary Issue**: API server was CommonJS but needed to be ES modules to work with shared package

### Solution Implemented
- **Shared Package**: Configured as ES modules with proper TypeScript output
  - `package.json`: Added `"type": "module"`
  - `tsconfig.json`: Set `"module": "ESNext"` 
  - **Result**: Built output uses `export const` instead of `exports.VARIABLE =`
- **API Server**: Converted to ES modules to match shared package
  - `package.json`: Added `"type": "module"`
  - `tsconfig.json`: Already configured with `"module": "ESNext"`
  - **Result**: Built output uses `import` statements instead of `require()`
- **Build Pipeline**: All packages now build successfully with ES module compatibility
  - Shared package: ES modules ‚úÖ
  - API server: ES modules ‚úÖ 
  - Web client: Compatible with ES module imports ‚úÖ

### Verification Completed
- **Local Builds**: All packages build without errors (`make build` successful)
- **Import Resolution**: `COMBAT_CONFIG` and other shared exports now properly accessible
- **Syntax Validation**: `node --check` passes for API server output
- **Docker Build**: Railway Dockerfile building successfully with ES modules

### Files Updated
- `shared/package.json` - Added `"type": "module"`
- `api-server/package.json` - Added `"type": "module"`
- Both packages rebuilt with ES module output

### Next Steps
- ‚úÖ **Local Testing**: Complete ES module conversion verified
- üîÑ **Railway Deployment**: Docker build in progress for final deployment test
- ‚è≠Ô∏è **Vercel Setup**: Deploy web client to Vercel after Railway verification

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Railway Production Deployment (July 5, 2025)

**Successfully resolved Railway deployment failures and achieved working production deployment.**

### Railway Deployment Issues Resolved
- **Prisma Client Generation**: Fixed "Prisma client did not initialize yet" errors with `postinstall` script
- **ES Module Compatibility**: Converted entire stack to ES modules for consistent module system
- **Import Path Resolution**: Replaced TypeScript path mappings with direct relative imports for Node.js ES module compatibility
- **Production Environment**: API server now running successfully on Railway at port 8080

### Technical Solutions Implemented
- **API Server Package.json**: Added `"postinstall": "prisma generate"` to ensure Prisma client generation

## üîç Discovered During Work

### Port & Configuration Issues (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)
- **Issue**: macOS Control Center uses port 5000, causing API server startup conflicts
- **Solution**: Changed API server to port 3001, updated all references in configs
- **Files Updated**: `.env`, `vite.config.ts`, `docker-compose.yml`, documentation

### Module System Resolution (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)  
- **Issue**: ES Module/CommonJS conflicts between shared package and API server
- **Solution**: Converted all packages to CommonJS, removed `"type": "module"` declarations
- **Tools Added**: `tsconfig-paths` for runtime path resolution

### Frontend Authentication URL Issue (RESOLVED ‚úÖ - July 6, 2025)
- **Issue**: Frontend making requests to `/api/api/auth/register` (double `/api`) causing "Not Found" errors
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Vite proxy routes `/api/*` requests to `http://localhost:3001`
  - AuthService was constructing URLs as `${VITE_API_URL}/api/auth` where VITE_API_URL already included `/api`
  - This created `http://localhost:3001/api/api/auth` URLs
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated AuthService to use relative URLs (`/api/auth`) that work with Vite proxy
  - Updated CharacterService to use same pattern (`/api/character`)
  - Removed dependency on VITE_API_URL environment variable for base URL construction
  - Disabled rate limiting in development mode to improve testing experience
- **Result**: Frontend authentication now works correctly, all auth endpoints accessible
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `web-client/src/services/authService.ts`
  - `web-client/src/services/CharacterService.ts`
  - `api-server/src/app.ts` (rate limiting disabled in development)
- **Testing**: 
  - ‚úÖ Automated test suite confirms API endpoints work through frontend proxy
  - ‚úÖ Manual testing confirms user registration, login, and character creation work
  - ‚úÖ Character persistence verified - characters persist across sessions

### PM2 Removal (RESOLVED ‚úÖ - July 6, 2025)
- **Issue**: PM2 causing development environment complexity and restart loops
- **Solution**: Removed PM2 completely, switched to npm scripts for development
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `ecosystem.config.json` and PM2 dependencies
  - Updated main `package.json` to use npm scripts with concurrently
  - Fixed API server restart loop by removing automatic prisma generation from startup
  - Created separate database initialization scripts
- **Result**: Cleaner development workflow, faster startup, easier debugging
- **Files Updated**: `package.json`, `api-server/package.json`, `api-server/src/app.ts`, `Makefile`
