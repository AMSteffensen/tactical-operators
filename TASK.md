## üî® Active Tasks

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Immediate Priority (Next Development Session)

* [ ] **WebGL Basic Setup** - Implement Three.js or Babylon.js for top-down tactical view
* [ ] **Real-time Communication** - Test and enhance Socket.IO integration between client/server
* [ ] **Character System MVP** - Create basic character creation and display in web client
* [ ] **Database Integration** - Connect frontend forms to backend APIs for character persistence

### üß± Core Systems

* [ ] Build basic WebGL rendering in React (top-down camera, map rendering)
* [ ] Create player squad management interface
* [ ] Implement persistent player state in backend (DB + API)
* [ ] Create soldier leveling and inventory system
* [ ] Implement basic combat loop logic (turn-based or real-time to be defined)
* [ ] Develop guild system with shared economy and permissions
* [ ] Build frontend state management (Zustand or Redux)

### üïπ Game Modes

* [ ] Add campaign mode with saved progress per group
* [ ] Support solo, co-op (2‚Äì4 players), and AI enemies
* [ ] Support offline/local-only play with NPCs
* [ ] Add character sync across rooms/groups (same state, new game)

### üì± Hybrid Tabletop System

* [ ] React Native app: Player inventory + economy dashboard
* [ ] Room joining system (like Kahoot) with real-time state sync
* [ ] Roll-out mat / board + phone = hybrid play design
* [ ] Per-round randomness handled digitally, played out physically

### üåê Backend / API

* [ ] Player API: create, update, fetch character/squad
* [ ] Guild API: create, update, invite/join, bank management
* [ ] Match/Room API: create room, join, sync state
* [ ] Campaign persistence per player and group
* [ ] WebSocket or Socket.IO room sync system

## üîç Discovered During Work

### Port & Configuration Issues (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)
- **Issue**: macOS Control Center uses port 5000, causing API server startup conflicts
- **Solution**: Changed API server to port 3001, updated all references in configs
- **Files Updated**: `.env`, `vite.config.ts`, `docker-compose.yml`, documentation

### Module System Resolution (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)  
- **Issue**: ES Module/CommonJS conflicts between shared package and API server
- **Solution**: Converted all packages to CommonJS, removed `"type": "module"` declarations
- **Tools Added**: `tsconfig-paths` for runtime path resolution

### Development Workflow Improvements
- **Added**: Concurrent development scripts with colored output
- **Added**: Status check script to verify environment health
- **Added**: Enhanced package.json scripts for better DX

### Next Session Notes
- API server successfully starts on port 3001
- Web client successfully starts on port 3000  
- Database container runs on port 5432
- Both can be started with `npm run dev` or separately in different terminals
- All builds are working (shared, api-server, web-client)

## üìÖ Planning

* Update `TASK.md` after each completed or started task
* Add newly discovered tasks under ‚ÄúDiscovered During Work‚Äù
* Reflect dependencies (e.g. guilds depend on player system)
* Discuss major changes in `PLANNING.md` before implementation
