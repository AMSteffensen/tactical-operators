- **Root Cause**: Vite configuration was pointing to shared package source directory (`../shared`) instead of built distribution directory (`../shared/dist`)
- **Module System Mismatch**: Shared package was built as CommonJS but Vite expected ES modules
- **Solution**:
  - Changed shared package from CommonJS to ES modules in tsconfig.json (`"module": "ESNext"`)
  - Added `"type": "module"` to shared/package.json
  - Updated vite.config.ts alias from `../shared` to `../shared/dist`
  - Rebuilt shared package to generate ES module exports
- **Result**: Production build now works successfully (`npm run build` completes without errors)

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Build Error Resolution (July 4, 2025)
- **Issue**: TypeScript compilation errors in InGameHUD component due to invalid CombatActionType references
- **Root Cause**: Code was using invalid action types 'reload' and 'skip' that don't exist in the CombatActionType enum
- **Valid Action Types**: 'move', 'attack', 'ability', 'item', 'defend', 'wait' (from shared/types/index.ts)
- **Solution**: Updated InGameHUD.tsx to use correct action types:
  - Changed 'reload' ‚Üí 'item' (for item usage/reloading)
  - Changed 'skip' ‚Üí 'wait' (for waiting/ending turn)
  - Updated button class names, onClick handlers, and conditional text
  - Fixed getActionCost() function to use valid action types
  - Updated action instruction text for consistency
- **Files Fixed**: `/web-client/src/components/InGameHUD.tsx`
